Abstract Since its introduction in 1982, percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMV) has been used successfully as an alternative to open or closed surgical mitral commissurotomy in the treatment of patients with symptomatic rheumatic mitral stenosis. PMV is safe and effective and provides sustained clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients with mitral stenosis. The immediate and long-term results appear to be similar to those of surgical mitral commissurotomy. Proper patient selection is an essential step for being able to predict the immediate results of PMV. Candidates for PMV require precise assessment of the mitral valve morphology. The Wilkin's echocardiographic score (Echo-Sc) is currently the most widely used method for predicting PMV outcome. Leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, valvular calcification, and sub valvular disease are each scored from 1 to 4. An inverse relationship exists between the Echo-Sc and PMV success. Both immediate and intermediate follow-up studies have shown that patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have superior results, significantly greater survival, and event free survival compared to patients with Echo-Sc {\textgreater} 8. We identified other clinical and morphologic predictors of PMV success that include age, pre-PMV mitral valve area, history of previous surgical commissurotomy, and mitral regurgitation (MR), and post-PMV variables (e.g., post-PMV MR ≥ 3 + and pulmonary artery pressure), that may be used in conjunction with the Echo-Sc to optimally identify candidates for PMV. This concept demonstrates a multifactorial nature of the prediction of immediate and long-term results. Other echocardiographic scores have been developed for the screening of potential candidates for PMV. They include a unique score that take into account the length of the chordae. A novel quantitative score that included the ratio of the commissural areas over the maximal excursion of the leaflets from the annulus in diastole. The components of this score include mitral valve area ≤ 1 cm 2 , maximum leaflet displacement ≤ 12 mm, commissural area ratio ≥ 1.25, and sub valvular involvement. Finally, a score that is able to identify patients who are more Page 2 of 24 Palacios Mini-invasive Surg 2020;4:73 I http://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1225.2020.72 likely to develop significant mitral regurgitation post-PMV. This score takes into account the distribution (even or uneven) of leaflet thickening and calcification, the degree and symmetry of commissural disease, and the severity of subvalvular disease. The transvenous transseptal approach is the most widely used PMV technique. The two major techniques of PMV are the double-balloon technique and the Inoue technique which are equally effective techniques of PMV. Encouraging results of PMV have been reported in special mitral stenosis population cohorts including pregnant women, patients with previous surgical commissurotomy, patients with atrial fibrillation, patients with pulmonary hypertension, elderly patients, patients with calcific mitral stenosis, and patients with associated aortic regurgitation. To summarize, PMV is the preferred form of therapy for relief of mitral stenosis for a selected group of patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis and suitable valve anatomy for valvuloplasty. Patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have the best results, particularly if they are young, are in normal sinus rhythm, have no pulmonary hypertension, and have no evidence of calcification of the mitral valve under fluoroscopy. The immediate and long-term results of PMV in this group of patients are similar to those reported after surgical mitral commissurotomy. Patients with Echo-Sc {\textgreater} 8 have only a 50{\%} chance to obtain a successful hemodynamic result with PMV, and the long-term follow-up results are worse than those from patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8. In patients with Echo-Sc ≥ 12, it is unlikely that PMV could produce good immediate or long-term results and they preferably should undergo mitral valve replacement. However, PMV could be considered in these patients if they are high-risk or unqualified surgical candidates.},

abstract = {Introduction: Rheumatic mitral stenosis continues to be prevalent in developing countries, notably in endemic areas. Over the last few decades, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) has been established as a lower-cost alternative treatment for mitral stenosis (MS) in low-to-middle-income countries. PBMV has also been suggested to be an effective and safe alternative treatment modality. This study aims to analyse the survival of rheumatic MS patients treated with PBMV compared with those treated with mitral valve surgery (MVS). Methods: This study was a national, single-centre, longitudinal study using a survival analysis method in 329 consecutive patients suffering from rheumatic heart disease with severe MS who underwent PBMV compared with 142 consecutive patients with similar characteristics who underwent MVS between January 2011 and December 2016. Survival analysis and event-free duration were determined over a median follow-up of 24 months in the PBMV group and 27 months in the MVS group. Results: The results showed that of the 329 consecutive patients in the PBMV group, 61 patients (18.5) had an event (6 patients died and 55 patients were hospitalised), and of the 142 consecutive patients in the MVS group, 19 patients (13.4{\%}) had an event (5 patients died, and 14 patients were hospitalised). The hazard ratio was 0.631 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.376–1.058; P = 0.081). Longer short-term survival was found in the MVS group but was not statistically significant. Event-free survival was significantly longer in the MVS group (P = 0.002), by 5 months. Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy and safety of PBMV was reconfirmed, as PBMV proved to be non-inferior to MVS in survival prognosis, but sustained event-free duration was significantly better in the MVS group than in the PBMV group.},

abstract = {Background: Aortic dissection as a complication of cardiac surgery is a rare but often lethal event. We sought to determine the frequency of this complication in the STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) database as well as the outcomes of patients who suffer intraoperative aortic dissection. We then developed a model to identify preoperative characteristics and intraoperative factors associated with the complication. Methods: All patients from the STS database who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve surgery, or mitral valve surgery were included. Exclusion criteria included any patient who had aortic dissection listed as a reason for urgent or emergent operation. Data collected were then analyzed to describe the frequency of aortic dissection as a complication as well as its consequences. We then analyzed a more recent era that included information on arterial cannulation site (femoral-other versus aortic) to identify risk factors for aortic dissection. Results: Of 2,219,991 patients analyzed, 1,294 suffered aortic dissection as a complication of their surgery, for an incidence of 0.06{\%}. This complication frequently led to catastrophic results, with 615 of 1,294 (48{\%}) operative mortality. A logistic regression model was created based on 2004 to 2007 STS data. Of 680,025 patients analyzed, 436 patients suffered an aortic dissection. The analysis yielded nine significant risk factors including femoral arterial cannulation, preoperative steroids, and Asian race; the presence of diabetes appeared to be protective. Conclusions: Aortic dissection is a rare but catastrophic complication of cardiac surgery. Femoral cannulation is associated with an increased frequency of this complication. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Twenty two patients (four men, 18 women, mean age 56 years, range 21 to 88 years) with a history ofrheumatic mitral stenosis were studied by cross sectional echocardiography before and after balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. The appearance of the mitral valve on the predilatation echocardiogram was scored for leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvar thickening, and calcification. Mitral valve area, left atrial volume, transmitral pressure difference, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, cardiac rhythm, New York Heart Association functional class, age, and sex were also studied. Because there was some increase in valve area in almost all patients the results were classified as optimal or suboptimal (final valve area {\textless}1.0 cm2 final left atrial pressure {\textgreater} 10 mm Hg, or final valve area {\textless} 25{\%} greater than the initial area). The best multiple logistic regression fit was found with the total echocardiographic score alone. Ahigh score (advanced leaflet deformity) was associated with a suboptimal outcome while a low score (a mobile valve with limited thickening) was associated with an optimal outcome. No other haemodynamic or clinical variables emerged as predictors of outcome in this analysis. Examination of pre-dilatation and post-dilatation echocardiograms showed that balloon dilatation reliably resulted in cleavage of the commissural plane and thus an increase in valve area.},

abstract = {Pulmonary carcinoid tumorlet is a rare pathology and appears to be always associated with other lesions such as bronchiectasis and fibrosis. While the caus e-effect relationship between tumorlet and the accompanying pathological changes in the surrounding mesenchymal tissue remains to be defined, it has been postulated that pulmonary fibrosis may be the primary pathology underlying the development of tumorlet. In this paper, we present a case where a tumor ({\textless}0.5 cm) was detected in the right upper lobe of a 71-year old woman. Cells of the tumor displayed markers characterizing for their neuroendocrine origin. No histological evidence for inflammation, interstitial fibrosis and remodeling of vascular structure was observed. However, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated a strong production of the profibrotic factors VEGF and TGF-$\beta$1 by tumor cells. These findings suggest that carcinoid tumorlet can be an isolated lesion and pulmonary fibrosis that "often co-exists" with tumorlet may be secondary to the paracrine effects of fibrotic growth factors produced by tumorlet.},

abstract = {Objective Pulmonary nocardiosis frequently develops as an opportunistic infection in patients with malig-nant tumor and is treated with steroids. This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary nocardiosis in Japan. Methods The patients definitively diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis at our hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Results Nineteen men and 11 women (30 in total) were diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Almost all patients were complicated by a non-pulmonary underlying disease, such as malignant tumor or collagen vas-cular disease, or pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumonia, and 13 patients (43.3{\%}) were treated with steroids or immunosuppressors. Gram staining was performed in 29 patients, and a characteristic Gram-positive rod was detected in 28 patients (96.6{\%}). Thirty-one strains of Nocardia were isolated and identified. Seven strains of Nocardia farcinica were isolated as the most frequent species, followed by Nocardia nova isolated from 6 patients. Seventeen patients died, giving a crude morality rate of 56.7{\%} and a 1-year survival rate of 55.4{\%}. The 1-year survival rates in the groups with and without immunosuppressant agents were 41.7{\%} and 59.7{\%}, respectively, showing that the outcome of those receiving immunosuppressants tended to be poorer than those not receiving them. Conclusion Pulmonary nocardiosis developed as an opportunistic infection in most cases. The outcome was relatively poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 55.4{\%}, and it was particularly poor in patients treated with im-munosuppressant agents. Pulmonary nocardiosis should always be considered in patients presenting with an opportunistic respiratory infection, and an early diagnosis requires sample collection and Gram staining.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Qualitative CT perfusion (CTP) assessment by using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) allows rapid calculation of infarct extent for middle cerebral artery infarcts. Published thresholds exist for noncontrast CT (NCCT) ASPECTS, which may distinguish outcome/complication risk, but early ischemic signs are difficult to detect. We hypothesized that different ASPECTS thresholds exist for CTP parameters versus NCCT and that these may be superior at predicting clinical and radiologic outcome in the acute setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six baseline acute stroke NCCT and CTP studies within 3 hours of symptoms were blindly reviewed by 3 neuroradiologists, and ASPECTS were assigned. Treatment response was defined as major neurologic improvement when a {\textgreater} or =8-point National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement at 24 hours occurred. Follow-up NCCT ASPECTS and 90-day modified Rankin score (mRS) were radiologic and clinical reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves derived optimal thresholds for outcome. RESULTS: Cerebral blood volume and NCCT ASPECTS had similar radiologic correlations (0.6 and 0.5, respectively) and best predicted infarct size in the absence of major neurologic improvement. A NCCT ASPECT threshold of 7 and a cerebral blood volume threshold of 8 discriminated patients with poor follow-up scans (P {\textless} .0002 and P = .0001) and mRS {\textless} or =2 (P = .001 and P {\textless} .001). Only cerebral blood volume predicted major neurologic improvement (P = .02). Interobserver agreement was substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.69). Cerebral blood volume ASPECTS sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for clinical outcome were 60{\%}, 100{\%}, 100{\%}, and 45{\%}, respectively. No patients with cerebral blood volume ASPECTS {\textless}8 achieved good clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Cerebral blood volume ASPECTS is equivalent to NCCT for predicting radiologic outcome but may have an additional benefit in predicting patients with major neurologic improvement.},

abstract = {Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are airway epithelial cells that are capable of secreting a variety of neuropeptides. PNECs are scattered throughout the bronchial tree either as individual cells or clusters of cells termed neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). PNECs and their secretory peptides have been considered to play a role in fetal lung development. Although the normal physiological function of PNECs and neuropeptides in normal adult lungs and in repair from lung injury is not known, PNEC hyperplasia has been associated with chronic lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and with chronic exposures, such as hypoxia, tobacco smoke, nitrosamines, and ozone. To evaluate changes in PNEC number and distribution after acute airway injury, FVB/n mice were treated with either naphthalene or vehicle. Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that, at the dose used in this study, selectively destroys nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells (Clara cells) through cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolic activation into cytotoxic epoxides. PNECs were identified by immunohistochemical analysis of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR). Proliferating cells were marked with [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Acute naphthalene toxicity results in PNEC hyperplasia that is detectable after 5 days of recovery. PNEC hyperplasia is characterized by increased numbers of NEBs without significant changes in the number of isolated PNECs and by increased [(3)H]thymidine labeling of CGRP-IR cells. These data show that cell proliferation contributes to PNEC hyperplasia after acute airway injury and suggest that PNECs may be capable of more rapidly increasing their number in response to injury than previously recognized.},

abstract = {Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (p-NETs) are a rare group of neoplasms but with increasing incidence. The atypical complications that arise in the setting of functional endocrine tumors are underreported and therefore have not received sufficient attention and the necessary mention in the oncology literature. The clinical implications of these complications pose management challenges starting with the difficulty in establishing diagnosis, accurate staging and optimal treatment of the primary process. We present the case of a middle-aged woman diagnosed with adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing carcinoma arising from the pancreas whose case was complicated by excessive uncontrolled hypercortisolism and reactivation of pulmonary opportunistic infections that confounded her management. We believe that this case illustration will be of value to practicing oncologists and other groups of physicians who are called upon to participate in the multidisciplinary Keywords: treatment of these relatively rare but highly challenging cases.},

We compared, in consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 2006 and 2014, 30-day mortality and in-hospital stroke incidence, operated either with perioperative modified TEE screening (intervention group) or only with conventional TEE screening (control group). Of the 8,605 study patients, modified TEE was applied in 1,391 patients (16.2{\%}).

abstract = {The introduction of brain imaging with computed tomography revolutionised the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. With the visual differentiation of haemorrhagic stroke from ischaemic stroke, thrombolytic therapy became feasible. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was devised to quantify the extent of early ischaemic changes in the middle cerebral artery territory on noncontrast computed tomography. With its systematic approach, the score is simple and reliable. However, the assessment of early ischaemic changes and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT scoring require training. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score is a strong predictor of functional outcome. Furthermore, the effectiveness of intraarterial thrombolysis in patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion shows effect modification by the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. This review summarises the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score methodology. We illustrate current knowledge regarding Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score applied to clinical trials and comment on how Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score may facilitate clinical treatment decision making and future trial design. Moreover, we introduce a modification of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score methodology that disregards isolated cortical swelling, i.e. focal brain swelling without associated parenchymal hypoattenuation, as early ischaemic changes in the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score system.},

Since the subgroup is not known at the design stage but can be learned statistically from the data collected during the course of the trial, we develop a novel group sequential design that incorporates adaptive choice of the patient subgroup among several possibilities which include the entire patient population as a choice. We define the type I and type II errors of a test in this design and show how a prescribed type I error can be maintained by using the closed testing principle in multiple testing. We also show how asymptotically optimal tests can be constructed by using generalized likelihood ratio statistics for parametric problems and analogous standardized or Studentized statistics for nonparametric tests such as Wilcoxon's rank sum test commonly used for treatment comparison in stroke patients.},

abstract = {Background: Rheumatic mitral stenosis is the most common valvular abnormalities found in developing countries. Mortality risk in those populations was poorly investigated. In addition, hemodynamic, morphological, and mechanical factors that influence or predict outcome of rheumatic mitral stenosis have not been identified. Aims: To determine predictive factors affecting outcome in rheumatic mitral stenosis patients. Method: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the National General Hospital Dr. Sardjito, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The study recruited patients from the Valvular Heart Disease Registry from May 2014 to November 2020. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, invasive or surgical treatment, and incidence of death were recorded. The baseline rhythm from electrocardiography (ECG) was categorized as sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Based on the findings of trans thoracal echocardiography (TTE), subjects who had moderate to severe pure rheumatic mitral stenosis (or followed by mitral regurgitation and / or less significant tricuspid regurgitation as a natural history) and subjects with rheumatic mitral stenosis with a combination of other heart valve problems (of which severity more significantly) classified as groups I and II. The mitral valve area (MVA), mitral valve gradient (MVG), left atrial diameter (LA), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were then analyzed. Results: A total of 477 patients (mean age 44.08 ± 10.93 years; 71.5{\%} female) were enrolled in this study. There were 61 deaths during the median follow up of 393 days of which 35 deaths occurred in group I and 26 deaths occurred in group II. Kaplan Meier curve shows the 1 year survival rate is higher in group I than group II which is 92.5{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively. Bivariate followed by multivariate analysis showed MVG and mPAP were predictive risk factors for mortality in group I with p = 0.020 and p = 0.021. MVG parameter values evaluated from echocardiography with a cut-off of more than 10 mmHg and mPAP parameters with a cut-off of more than 50 mmHg were independent predictive risk factors for mortality. Thus, patients were at higher risk of death if MVG {\textgreater} 10 mmHg and mPAP {\textgreater} 50 mmHg Conclusion: One year survival rate in group I was higher than group II. MVG and mPAP were risk factors for predicting mortality in group I.},

HE is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis and is thus considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of HE is low, but death and status epilepticus have been reported. HE manifests with a wide range of symptoms that include behavioral changes and confusion. Elevated thyroid antibodies are present in the majority of cases and are required for the diagnosis of HE. Normal brain MRI findings are found in the majority of patients diagnosed with HE. The most consistent CSF abnormality noted in HE patients is the presence of elevated protein. Most HE patients respond well to steroid therapy. Clinical improvements are also observed with IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. In conclusion, it is now generally accepted that the diagnosis of HE must include encephalopathy characterized by cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric features, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Autoimmune encephalitis and prion disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical features of these conditions to those of HE.},

We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between the degree of reperfusion achieved and clinical outcomes in target mismatch (TMM) patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The degree of reperfusion was calculated on the basis of the difference in perfusion-weighted imaging volumes (time to maximum of tissue residue function [Tmax]{\textgreater}6 s) between the baseline MRI and the early post-treatment follow-up scan. Patients were grouped into quartiles, on the basis of degree of reperfusion achieved, and the association between the degree of reperfusion and clinical outcomes in TMM and no TMM patients was assessed. Favorable clinical response was determined at day 30 on the basis of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at day 90.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This study included 121 patients; 98 of these had TMM. The median degree of reperfusion achieved was not different in TMM patients (60{\%}) versus No TMM patients (64{\%}; P=0.604). The degree of reperfusion was strongly correlated with both favorable clinical response (P{\textless}0.001) and good functional outcome (P=0.001) in TMM patients; no correlation was present in no TMM. The frequency of achieving favorable clinical response or good functional outcome was significantly higher in TMM patients in the highest reperfusion quartile versus the lower 3 quartiles (88{\%} versus 41{\%} as odds ratio, 10.3; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.8-37.5; and 75{\%} versus 34{\%} as odds ratio, 5.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.1-16.7, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 90{\%} as the optimal reperfusion threshold for predicting good functional outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The degree of reperfusion documented on perfusion-weighted imaging after reperfusion therapies corresponds closely with clinical outcomes in TMM patients.

abstract = {Background The effect of endovascular thrombectomy that is performed more than 6 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke is uncertain. Patients with a clinical deficit that is disproportionately severe relative to the infarct volume may benefit from late thrombectomy. Methods We enrolled patients with occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between the severity of the clinical deficit and the infarct volume, with mismatch criteria defined according to age ({\textless}80 years or ≥80 years). Patients were randomly assigned to thrombectomy plus standard care (the thrombectomy group) or to standard care alone (the control group). The coprimary end points were the mean score for disability on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale (which ranges from 0 [death] to 10 [no symptoms or disability]) and the rate of functional independence (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) at 90 days. Results A total of 206 patients were enrolled; 107 were assigned to the thrombectomy group and 99 to the control group. At 31 months, enrollment in the trial was stopped because of the results of a prespecified interim analysis. The mean score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 5.5 in the thrombectomy group as compared with 3.4 in the control group (adjusted difference [Bayesian analysis], 2.0 points; 95{\%} credible interval, 1.1 to 3.0; posterior probability of superiority, {\textgreater}0.999), and the rate of functional independence at 90 days was 49{\%} in the thrombectomy group as compared with 13{\%} in the control group (adjusted difference, 33 percentage points; 95{\%} credible interval, 24 to 44; posterior probability of superiority, {\textgreater}0.999). The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (6{\%} in the thrombectomy group and 3{\%} in the control group, P=0.50), nor did 90-day mortality (19{\%} and 18{\%}, respectively; P=1.00). Conclusions Among patients with acute stroke who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between clinical deficit and infarct, outcomes for disability at 90 days were better with thrombectomy plus standard care than with standard care alone.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this article are to review the radiologic, pathologic, and clinical features of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, tumorlet, and carcinoids and to discuss the possible role of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and tumorlet in the development of carcinoids. CONCLUSION: Given the potential significant morbidity of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and its neoplastic counterparts, it is important to understand and recognize these disease entities. A conceptual continuum of these neuroendocrine entities is suggested.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Thrombectomy is currently recommended for eligible patients with stroke who are treated within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. Methods We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded outcome assessment, of thrombectomy in patients 6 to 16 hours after they were last known to be well and who had remaining ischemic brain tissue that was not yet infarcted. Patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion, an initial infarct size of less than 70 ml, and a ratio of the volume of ischemic tissue on perfusion imaging to infarct volume of 1.8 or more were randomly assigned to endovascular therapy (thrombectomy) plus standard medical therapy (endovascular-therapy group) or standard medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group). The primary outcome was the ordinal score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability) at day 90. Results The trial was conducted at 38 U.S. centers and termina...},
