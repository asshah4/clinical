As part of both residency and fellowship training, volume is an important part of both procedural competence and clinical skills. 


```{r}
#| label: download
#| echo: false
#source("R/make-anonymous.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
log <- readr::read_csv("anonymous.csv") 

start <- min(log$date, na.rm = TRUE)
stop <- max(log$date, na.rm = TRUE)

# Columns = site | mrn | date | dx1:3 | procedure | location | modifier | notes | special
# Can be broken down into groups based on procedures versus clinical 
procedures <- subset(log, !is.na(procedure)) |>
	rename(type = procedure)
clinical <- subset(log, is.na(procedure))
```

Below is a summary of procedures that have been performed during training.

```{r}

	cath = c("COR", "RHC", "LHC", "PCI", "pericardiocentesis", "MCS"),
	vascular = c("CVL", "AL", "PIV", "closure"),
	ep = c("DCCV", "CIED", "EPS", "TVP", "ACLS"),
	imaging = c("TTE", "TEE", "stress", "MRI", "CT", "US")
)

# Create categories
cats <- character()
for (i in seq_along(types)) {
	cats <- append(cats, rep(names(types[i]), length(types[[i]])))
}

# Make table
tbl <- tibble(
	category = cats,
	type = unlist(types)
)

# Identifiers of procedure modifiers with categorizations
subtypes <-
	procedures |>
	select(type, location, modifier) 

# Master table
master <- full_join(tbl, subtypes, by = "type")

# Some procedures need specific modifiers, located in the location name
	# Caths -> needs modifier for site
	# TTE -> needs modifier for bedside or not
	# TEE -> needs modifier for if bedside or not
	# EPS -> needs modifier for type
	# DCCV -> modifier for joules, not really needed
	# TVP -> modifier
	# AL/CVL -> lines with locations in modifier

```
