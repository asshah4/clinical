As part of both residency and fellowship training, volume is an important part of both procedural competence and clinical skills. 

```{r, procedures, echo = FALSE}
# Main log
log <-

	janitor::clean_names() %>%
	mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
	tibble::as_tibble()

start <- min(log$date, na.rm = TRUE)
stop <- max(log$date, na.rm = TRUE)

# Columns = site | mrn | date | dx1:3 | procedure | location | modifier | notes | special
# Can be broken down into groups based on procedures versus clinical 
procedures <- subset(log, !is.na(procedure))

# Obtain summaries of types
what <- unique(log$procedure)
where <- unique(log$location)

# Some procedures need specific modifiers, located in the location name
	# Caths -> needs modifier for site
	# TTE -> needs modifier for bedside or not
	# TEE -> needs modifier for if bedside or not
	# EPS -> needs modifier for type
	# DCCV -> modifier for joules, not really needed
	# TVP -> modifier
	# AL/CVL -> lines with locations in modifier
