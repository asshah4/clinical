    "text": "Internal Medicine Residency\n\nFebruary 18, 2019 As a medical resident, we complete a senior grand rounds, a summative talk of an area of our choosing. I researched psychological triggers for sudden cardiac death, and gave a “chalk talk” style presentation. There was an associated handout and notes with references. The concept of psychological triggers as affecting the ventricular substrate is fascinating, particularly as we learn more of the role of the autonomic nervous system in cardiovascular disease.\nSeptember 26, 2018 Another bite-sized teaching mode talk on transfusions in sickle cell. Gave this talk again on October 4, 2018 at the Southern Hospital Medicine conference as an example of alternative teaching methods.\nMarch 21, 2018 With literature from early-terminated trials during 2018, I gave a journal club lecture on the updated guidelines on thrombectomy for ischemic strokes. My notes for it serve as a reference and series of citations, with a handout to improve viewer interaction. The largest issue I find was in the interpretation of their Table 1 showing non-adjusted odds ratios for an ordinal scale, listed next to a P-value.\nMarch 15, 2018 As a resident, there is a shift into becoming a teacher to both medical students and near-peers while being a learner as well. A significant amount of residents actually develop critical failures in the learning process. Here is an approach I presented, with supporting literature and an outline to be shared.\nFebruary 28, 2018 I gave a bite-sized teaching mode talk on treating rashes. The purpose of this style of talk is to explain and actually teach a topic in less than 8 minutes. Giving the talk itself emphasized learning how to teach."

In light of the above, I would like to recommend that the patient would obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram and see his cardiologist, Physician, so that we can assess his severity of his mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis and regurgitation more thoroughly. If the patient had evidence of severe mitral regurgitation, then I would strongly recommend considering him for open-heart surgery and mitral valve repair or replacement, at the time of which we will address the aortic pathology as well."
