## Definition 

- SVT implies involvement of &ge; 1 structure above bifurcation of the His bundle (HB).
- [AVNRT]{.orange} is usually a narrow-complex tachycardia that uses the AV node, and functional/anatomical pathways (slow/fast)
- [Typical AVNRT]{.orange} uses a [slow]{.red} conducting antegrade pathway and a [fast]{.blue} conducting retrograde limb

. . .

[_Remains unclear if the muscular atrium or structures within the Triangle of Koch are obligate part of reentry or passive bystanders_]{.grey}

# Diagnosis

---

- Most common paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [@Kwaku2002]
- Approximately 50% of SVT cases in adults are from an AVNRT mechanism  [@Issa2018]
- Woman are affected twice as frequently as men [@Goyal1996]
- Most patients are between 18-40 years of age [@Goyal1996]
- [Typical AVNRT]{.orange} accounts for 90% of cases

---

## A [differential]{.green} for a regular SVT?

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
__Narrow QRS__

- AVNRT
- AT
- Orthodromic AVRT due to an accessory pathway
- AFL with fixed AV conduction
- SANRT
- High septal VT
- ST
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
__Wide QRS__

- AVNRT or AT  with aberrancy
- AVNRT with a bystander accessory pathway
- Antidromic AVRT due to an accessory pathway
- SVT with wider QRS due to electrolyte/AAD therapies
:::

:::

---

## Does the history matter?

- Sudden onset and termination (often positional) more often re-entrant
- Abortive measures such as drinking iced water
- Dizziness and hypotension occur more commonly in short RP tachycardias
- Polyuria/diuresis during tachycardia or at termination due to increased ANP secretion [@Abe1997b]

---

What next?

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
- Physical exam?
:::
- 24-48 hour Holter?
- 2-4 weeks of cardiac event monitoring?
- Exercise testing?
- Echocardiogram?
- EP testing?

## Does the exam matter?

- _Neck pounding_ manifests with continuous pulsing cannon A waves, as the RA contracts against a closed tricuspid valve, described as the [frog sign]{.green} [@Sakhuja2009]
	- Does not occur in orthodromic AVRT, as longer VA interval separates the chamber contractions
	- 7-fold increase in AVNRT over other SVT with this symptom

## Vagal Maneuvers {.smaller}

---

### Valsalva maneuver

- Also called _Flack's test_, where intrapleural pressure is raised to 40 mm Hg (expiration against closed airway)
- Bradycardia effect seen within first 10-15 seconds

![](valsalva-hemodynamics.png)

---

### Carotid sinus massage

1. Holding constant pressure (not a "massage") for 5-10 seconds
1. Increases pressure in carotid body, firing baroreceptors
1. SNS afferent response leads to PNS efferents via vagus (right = SA, left = AV)
1. Responses...
	- _cardioinhibitory_ with &ge; 3s pause
	- _vasodepressor_ is drop of &ge; 50 mm Hg in pressure
	- _mixed_

### Adenosine

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
90% success rate:

1. 6 mg bolus
1. 12 mg bolus
1. 18 mg bolus

Repeat dosing after 1 minute (30 seconds for complete effect). Better efficacy with "single syringe strategy" [@Kotruchin2022]
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- an endogenous purine nuceloside, binding to cardiac adenosine A1 receptors 
- dose-related prolongation of AV conduction at AH interval
